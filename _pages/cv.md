Education
======
* M.Res. in UK, University of Nottingham, 2024 (Expected)
* B.S. in China, China Pharmaceutical University, 2019

Research experience
======
* Fall 2024: Reconstitution of the core Ccr4-Not complex
  * Role: Project manager
  * University of Nottingham
  * Experimental goal: Since Ccr4 protein plays a key role in the degradation process of mRNA, this project mainly hopes to analyze and purify Ccr4-Not protein fragments through technical means and purify different key fragments. This project hopes to continue to analyze protein structure and fragment function through technical means.
  * Duties includes: Complete the following experiments independently: PCR, Werstern Blot, Protein Purification, DNA & Plasmid Miniprep, Cloning, Transformation, Gel Electrophoresis,etc.

* Summer 2023: The anti-inflammatory function and biogenesis mechanism of the newly evolved circular RNA circIRAK3
  * Role: Main researcher
  * China Pharmaceutical University
  * Experimental goal: In our group's previous experiments, we discovered a certain circular RNA, and after preliminary sequencing, we found that knocking it down can regulate the inflammatory response.Now we are mainly doing extensive knockdown experiments and sequencing.
  * Duties included: Complete the following experiments independently: Knockdown and sequencing of specific circular RNA, Protein BCA quantification, ELISA,Westernblot, qPCR.

* Fall 2022: Ubiquitination or Ubiquitination-like Modification of STING Protein Upregulates the Body's Innate Immune Response
  * Role: Research Assistant
  * China Pharmaceutical University
  * Experimental goal: Experimental goal: To demonstrate that the ubiquitinated STING protein can activate the innate immune response more rapidly and more vigorously than normal STING protein under the stimulation of cGAMP.
  * Duties included: Complete the following experiments independently: co-immunoprecipitation, Western blot, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, ELISA,etc.To confirm that the target protein is correctly expressed and can bind more downstream signal molecules. 

* Fall 2021: Assessment of the Therapeutic Effect of Breast Cold Compress on Breast Nodules
  * Role: Research Assistant
  * China Pharmaceutical University
  * Main purpose: To check the safety and effectiveness of the products to be launched by the company   through the investigation of the efficacy and mechanism of action of breast cold compresses circulating in the market, and to put forward suggestions for improvement. 
  * Duties included: Responsible for literature retrieval, review, sorting and information integration to understand the definition of breast cold compress through a literature survey and learn about the varieties of breast cold compresses on the market, the patents on breast cold compresses, and the main effects and adverse reactions of the commercially available breast cold compresses.

* Summer 2020: Effect of IRF8 on Precancerous and Post-Cancerous Liver Cancer
  * Role: Research Assistant
  * China Pharmaceutical University
  * Experimental goal: To explore the effect of the IRF8 gene on the precancer and post-cancer of liver cancer by injecting liver cancer cells into experimental mice knocked out of the IRF8 gene and comparing the disease course and the changes in pathological parameters after dissection of the experimental group and the control group. 
  * Duties included: Responsible for the operation of basic experiments such as protein BCA quantification, protein extraction, DNA extraction, RNA extraction, RNA quantification, gene identification, feeding and administration of laboratory mice and cell inheritance.
