Project:"Reconstitution of the core Ccr4-Not complex"                  10/2023-present
University of Nottingham
Role: Project manager
• Experimental goal: Since Ccr4 protein plays a key role in the degradation process of mRNA, this project mainly hopes to analyze and purify Ccr4-Not protein fragments through technical means and purify different key fragments. This project hopes to continue to analyze protein structure and fragment function through technical means.
• Complete the following experiments independently: PCR, Werstern Blot, Protein Purification, DNA & Plasmid Miniprep, Cloning, Transformation, Gel Electrophoresis,etc.
• During the master's degree, I completed experimental projects independently, reported and discussed with my supervisor every week, and participated in laboratory group meetings every month. Able to independently report project progress and produce research posters. Be familiar with basic experimental operations, know how to promote experiments, and solve difficulties encountered in the project.

Project:" The anti-inflammatory function and biogenesis mechanism of the newly evolved circular RNA circIRAK3"                                                                                                                        02/2023-06/2023
China Pharmaceutical University
Role: Main researcher 
• Experimental goal: In our group's previous experiments, we discovered a certain circular RNA, and after preliminary sequencing, we found that knocking it down can regulate the inflammatory response.Now we are mainly doing extensive knockdown experiments and sequencing.
• Complete the following experiments independently: Knockdown and sequencing of specific circular RNA, Protein BCA quantification, ELISA,Westernblot, qPCR.
• Independently complete the preliminary design of the experiment and the implementation of the pre-experiment.Complete the improvement of the experimental program based on the results of the pre-experiment and preliminary sequencing, and process the experimental data after that.Complete the writing of the graduation thesis and the report of the graduation thesis.

Project:"Ubiquitination or Ubiquitination-like Modification of STING Protein Upregulates the Body's Innate Immune Response"                                                                                                             02/2022-11/2022 
China Pharmaceutical University
Role: Laboratory assistant 
• Experimental goal: To demonstrate that the ubiquitinated STING protein can activate the innate immune response more rapidly and more vigorously than normal STING protein under the stimulation of cGAMP. 
• Complete the following experiments independently: co-immunoprecipitation, Western blot, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, ELISA,etc.To confirm that the target protein is correctly expressed and can bind more downstream signal molecules. 
• Improve relevant techniques, especially co-IP. 

Project:"Assessment of the Therapeutic Effect of Breast Cold Compress on Breast Nodules”                     03/2021-09/2021
China Pharmaceutical University
Role: Laboratory assistant                                                             
• Main purpose: To check the safety and effectiveness of the products to be launched by the company   through the investigation of the efficacy and mechanism of action of breast cold compresses circulating in the market, and to put forward suggestions for improvement. 
• Responsible for literature retrieval, review, sorting and information integration to understand the definition of breast cold compress through a literature survey and learn about the varieties of breast cold compresses on the market, the patents on breast cold compresses, and the main effects and adverse reactions of the commercially available breast cold compresses. 
• Mastered the skills of literature retrieval, reading, sorting and information synthesis and improved research capability and efficiency. 

Project:“Effect of IRF8 on Precancerous and Post-Cancerous Liver Cancer”                                    06/2020-10/2020  
China Pharmaceutical University
Role: Member of the "Top-notch Program Summer Training Camp" 
• Project goal: To explore the effect of the IRF8 gene on the precancer and post-cancer of liver cancer by injecting liver cancer cells into experimental mice knocked out of the IRF8 gene and comparing the disease course and the changes in pathological parameters after dissection of the experimental group and the control group. 
• Responsible for the operation of basic experiments such as protein BCA quantification, protein extraction, DNA extraction, RNA extraction, RNA quantification, gene identification, feeding and administration of laboratory mice and cell inheritance. 
• Familiarized with laboratory routines and grasped basic experimental skills about proteins, DNA, RNA, cells, and mouse anatomy.
