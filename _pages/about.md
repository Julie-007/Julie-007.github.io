I have gratuated from China Pharmaceutical University(https://www.cpu.edu.cn/) as an undergraduate student. I majored in pharmacy. My research during my undergraduate period are mainly focus on the molecular regulation of inflammatory factors and the regulation of innate immune responses by ubiquitination and ubiquitination-like modifications, with the methodology of Cell Biology and Molecular Biology experimental methods. My previous research has also focused on the molecular mechanisms behind the signaling events of the cGAS-STING pathway and targeting these pathways to develop new immunology therapeutics for disease as well as the role kinases play in the pathway. 

I am a Master student from School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham(https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/). Now I am completing my MRes degree in University of Nottingham and I will graduate in October this year. And my project is mainly focus on the structure and reconstitution of the core Ccr4-Not complex.
